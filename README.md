 A Hangman game in Ruby for TOP

This is a **VERY** basic hangman game to solidify further
the concepts of working with Class Objects and Modules,
arrays, etc...

Displays all the key data of classic hangman, but without
the graphics(may spend 30min and add it in one day).

The cool feature, for me, was using what I recently learned
about serialization to create the ability to save the game
and come back to it later.

The simplicity of serializing objects and their state to
a YAML or JSON solidified the utlity of having a Class 
that can produce objects with pre-loaded instance variables.

Also, enjoying organizing my spaghetti with the use of module
mixins. Loads of fun.
